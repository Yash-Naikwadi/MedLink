# Summary of Changes - MedLink Health Records System

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to complete the frontend and integrate it with the backend.

---

## üéØ Major Issues Fixed

### 1. Route Mismatch Fixed
- **Issue**: Login was redirecting to `/user-dashboard` and `/doctor-dashboard` but routes were `/user` and `/doctor`
- **Fix**: Updated Login.js to navigate to correct routes (`/user` and `/doctor`)

### 2. API Endpoints Corrected
- **Issue**: API endpoints didn't match backend routes
- **Fix**: Updated `frontend/src/config/api.js` with correct endpoints:
  - Added `VIEW`, `REVOKE`, `GET_PRESCRIPTION` for patient reports
  - Changed doctor endpoint from `ADD_FEEDBACK` to `ADD_PRESCRIPTION` with proper reportHash parameter
  - Fixed backend URL from port 4939 to 5000

### 3. File Upload Field Name
- **Issue**: Frontend was sending file as `report` but backend expects `file`
- **Fix**: Changed FormData field name in UserDashboard.js
